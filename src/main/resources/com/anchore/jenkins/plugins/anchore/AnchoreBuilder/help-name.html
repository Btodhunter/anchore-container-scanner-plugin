  This is the file name that contains a list of container images for
  anchore to analyze, evaluate policy, and run queries against.  The
  format for each line is "imageId /path/to/Dockerfile", where the
  Dockerfile is optional.  Before the anchore build step, your
  previous build steps must create and populate this file.
